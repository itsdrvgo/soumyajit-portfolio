## **Message from the Creator**
---
Hey, **DRVGO** here. All the needed documentations are hyper-linked with the package names. This was a side project of mine, and I'm publishing it publicly, so that people can understand and learn complex concepts of react, auth and data fetching-caching.

If you find any bug, feel free to post an issue and if you know the fix for it, feel free to fork it and create a pull request. We'll verifiy it, and merge it.

If you like this project, kindly give it a star.

## **How to Run the Application**
---
1. Clone the project in your local system.
2. Open the terminal and install using `pnpm i` (if you're using npm, you might wanna migrate the package manager).
3. Once all the packages are installed, run `pnpm dev` (if you're on development mode). To make a production build, first use `pnpm build`, and then `pnpm start`.
4. The application will be hosted locally on `http://localhost:3000`.
5. To install UI components, make sure you read the [guide](https://ui.shadcn.com/).
